# ExpressionEngine Changelog

ExpressionEngine uses semantic versioning. This file contains changes to ExpressionEngine since the last Build / Version release for PATCH version changes only.

## Patch Release

Bullet list below, e.g.
- Added <new feature>
- Fixed the consent form's return behavior.
- Fixed "Select Dropdown" "Populate the menu from another channel field" not showing any field options.
- Changing a custom field type now resets the field settings.  Having the wrong settings for a field was causing display issues for some addons.
